    <h1>Breaking: Microsoft announces a revolutionary new keyboard designed exclusively for vibe coding!</h1>

    <p>
      Redmond. In a groundbreaking move that is sending shockwaves through the developer community, Microsoft
      has announced the release of the new TabBoard, a next-generation keyboard designed specifically for vibe coding.
      It features a sleek minimalist design, that consists of a single, perfectly tuned Tab key.
    </p>
    <h2>A Keyboard Like No Other</h2>
    <p>
      The TabBoard is a masterpiece of engineering. Encased in an stainless steel frame with a premium, touch-sensitive 
      Tab key. This keyboard is designed for efficiency, style, and maximum vibes. Microsoft's engineers have spent years 
      perfecting the key's tactile response, ensuring the ultimate tabbing experience while vibe coding with Copilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We noticed that 97% of all keystrokes made by real vibe coders were just pressing Tab over and over," said Kris He, 
      Microsoft's Lead Keyboard Innovation Architect. "So we thought, 'Why complicate things?' The TabBoard simplifies 
      coding to its purest Copilot form. The exact way developers of yore intended coding to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be our ruin!" cried a developer from a competing company. "After all these years of making development 
      more and more difficult, Microsoft had to come and burst our bubble!" They expressed concerns that a single key wouldn't 
      be enough, but as Kris He commented, "It will be more than enough thanks to its seamless integration with Android and 
      iPhone. Just say out loud, 'I have an idea! Wouldn't it be great if...' near your phone, and Microsoft will receive 
      the information immediately. Copilot will then assist with your coding as soon as you start using the TabBoard."
    </p>
    <h2>Expected to sell out</h2>
    <p>
      With an advanced Tab key mechanism and premium build quality, Microsoft’s TabBoard is an absolute steal at just $249.99. 
      No developer wants to miss the chance to own the only keyboard they’ll ever need to become a 10x Engineer. Why type when 
      they can tab?
    </p>
    <p>
      Available for pre-order starting next week, the TabBoard is expected to sell out instantly. Early adopters will also receive 
      a limited-edition carrying case and a physical AI Assistant to help with the coding tasks free for perpetuity!
