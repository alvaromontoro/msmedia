    <p>
      Redmond. In a groundbreaking move that is sending shockwaves through the developer community, Microsoft
      has announced the release of the TabBoard, a next-generation keyboard designed specifically for vibe coding.
      It features a sleek, minimalist design, that consists of a single, perfectly tuned Tab key.
    </p>
    <h2>Expected to sell out</h2>
    <p>
      With an advanced Tab key mechanism and premium build quality, Microsoft’s TabBoard is an absolute steal at just $249.99. 
      Early adopters will also receive a limited-edition carrying case—because a keyboard this revolutionary deserves VIP treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Available for pre-order starting next week, the TabBoard is expected to sell out instantly. Don’t miss your chance to own 
      the only keyboard you’ll ever need to become a 10x Engineer. Why type when you can Tab?
